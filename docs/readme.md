# UForm Kit Overview
UForm Kit is a package for Umbraco which enables you to create and manage multiple contact forms on your site,  and customize the form and the mail contents flexibly with simple markup.

UForm Kit is heavily inspired and influenced by the ContactForm7 plugin for WordPress - https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/ and we feel that the Umbraco community would benefit from similar solution.
